In all the years that I have been training dogs I have met hundreds of dog owners that addopted a dog not knowing anything about them. When it came to training they always expected me to train their dog for them not knowing that I was there to teach them how to train their dog. Then when it came to health almost nobody knew about the posible health risk for their dogs specific breed. I also have came across many dog owners that wanted or needed training but couldnt afford it. All of this let me to want to create a one stop shop application that has everything about dogs that you could possibly need. With PleasantPup you can create a personlized dog profile with breed specific information for your dog, learn how to teach your dog basic commands, and create posts sharing best practices and updates about your dogs life.
